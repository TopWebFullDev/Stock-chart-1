hi! 
it has places in Asia only. 
so, when you click anywhere on the map in Aisa, it should search for places around that clicking point. 

then it should return and display those places. 

now, it does not return anything

it's using elasticsearch to search. 

i checked server. elasticsearch is working.

so, pls check why it does not get any result.
