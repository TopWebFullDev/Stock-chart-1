1. Stock Chart
when i click Stock Chart, it displays the complete symbol list. that's not necessary. 

pls simply display the list of symbols added into the list. 

so, only display the list we're interested. 

but we can add a new symobol, or delete an existing symbol here. 


2. Stock Screener
for all the symbols, let's store their daily and weely price in our database. 

it'll read data for all symbols, and then display the list of symbols that follow the criteria. In this case, you need to read price data and store them all in the database. then, you can process them, and sort them. 
finally, you can display a list of symbols. 

screening method, as already described in the doc!

so, when data are already downnloaded in our db, this will be easy!

otherwise, you need to download data over and over again! this will be terrible. 


so, everyday, it should read data for all symbols and store in db. This can be done using a cron job, that runs at 1AM every morning. 

then, all processing is based on data in db.
